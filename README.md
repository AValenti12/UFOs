# UFOs

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage to show filtered results of UFO sightings. We expanded the filters available to be able to provide a more in depth look at UFO sightings.

# Results

We added the additional filters
- date
- location
- UFO descriptive data
- witness comments

You can then filter all the results by using any of the additional filters. For example, if you were looking to see all UFO sightings from 1/7/2010, you would enter that date and all the sightings from that date would appear.

![172010](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88061345/138603859-2a48f66f-1c0d-47f5-b85c-d28be9986f22.PNG)

You could also search by city.

And then use one, some, or all of the search criteria to filter any specific inquiry you are looking for.


# Summary

- Drawback
  One drawback worth noting is that the site is case sensitive. So if the user does not type the city, state, etc in exactly as the data is, the search result will not be inclusive of all the data that might be applicable. For example, from the previous search of "bonita" resulted in 1 entry. When "Bonita" is searched, there are zero results.

- Recommendations
  I would probably recommend the case sensitivity be adjusted. A useful filter to add would be maybe duration. To allow users to filter by experiences under one minute, 10 minutes, over 30, etc. Another recommendation that might be helpful would be to add a counter when a search result is completed. So at quick glance a user can see how many sightings there were based off that search criteria.
